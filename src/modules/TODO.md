Starting the building process for the reminder system

1. - Set reminders with title, description, date, and time(already at the ProductivitySuite.jsx File)
2. - Notify users when reminder is due(will have to check how to add a sound to it online)
3. - Allow recurring reminders (daily, weekly, monthly) 
4. - Categorize reminders (work, personal, etc.)(will try to do so. //optional)
5 .- Search/filter functionality

FOR THE POP-UP SOUND NOT WORKING

1. Interact with the page (click/test sound) after loading.
2. Confirm the sound URL works in your browser.
3. Check your device volume.
4. Wait for the exact minute (and up to 30 seconds after).
5. Try the "Test Sound" button.
